## Type of Campaign
According to our analysis, theater is the best type of campaign for success.

Further analysis suggests that plays will be far more successful than any other type of theater campaign.

## Monetary Goal
For plays in the United States, most successful campaigns starting out with a goal of $10,000, are unsuccessful. Successful campaigns have a median goal of around $3,0000 and a mean goal of $5,000. Our suggestion to Louis is to see how she can reduce the amount needed for her play in order for the campaign to be successful.

## Time of Year
We also suggest that Louis begin her campaing in May or June and run for about a month. Most successful campaigns seem to run in these months as can be seen by the graph shown.
