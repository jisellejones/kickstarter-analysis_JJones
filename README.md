# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Monetary Goal
For plays in the United States, most successful campaigns starting out with a goal of $10,000, are unsuccessful. Successful campaigns have a median goal of around $3,0000 and a mean goal of $5,000. Our suggestion to Louis is to see how she can reduce the amount needed for her play in order for it to be successful.
## Time of Year
We also suggest that Louis begin her campaing in May or June and run for about a month. Most successful campaigns seem to run in these months as can be seen by the graph shown.
