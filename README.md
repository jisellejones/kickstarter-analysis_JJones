# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Past analyses of crowdfunding data, showed a possible correlation between the success of Kickstarter campaigns, their launch dates, and their funding goals. This analysis will dive more deeply into the outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

---
### Purpose
This analysis proposes to answer the following questions:
* How do different theater campaigns for plays fare in relation to their launch date?
* Are some months of the year better than others for launching theater campaigns for plays?
* How do different theater campaigns for plays fare in relation to their funding goals?
* Is there any pattern in the amount of funding goals and the success of theater campaigns for plays? Are campaigns in some goal ranges more successful than campaigns in other goal ranges?

## Analysis and Challenges
The crowdfunding data used in this analysis was pulled from the University of Oregon Data Analysis Boot Camp database. The data was filtered and analyzed using Excel's formulas, statistical tools, and graphic displays. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
How do different theater campaigns for plays fare in relation to their launch date? Are some months of the year better than others for launching theater campaigns for plays? In order to answer these questions, we filtered the theater data by month and disagregated the data by outcome. For successful campaigns, we see a spike in the graph around May and then a decline over from May to September; however, there are still a high number of successful campaigns during June. This could indicate that starting a campaign in May or June may yield the highest success rate. While the overall data for outcomes based on launch date show a high success rate during the month of May, the data also show a spike in the number of campaigns that fail. In fact, the month of May shows the highest failure rate of all the months. This leads to the question, "Is the higher number of both successes and failures due to the higher number of campaigns started during the month of May?" In order to answer this question, we compared the percentages of successful and failed campaigns for each month (graph 2). The graph based on percentages still shows an increase of succesfful campaigns in the month of May, but now we see a decrease in the percentage of failed campaigns during the same month indicating that indeed, beginning a campaign in the month of may could yield higher rates of success. The percentage of failed campaigns spike during the month of December while the percentage of successful campaigns decreases in the same month which wou

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Unfortunately, there was not enough data in the plays category to capture patterns within the canceled campaigns. Future analyses may consider taking a closer look at this data set by analyzing canceled campaigns across all parent categories rather than simply the play subcategory.



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns - Homework
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Type of Campaign
According to our analysis, theater is the best type of campaign for success.

Further analysis suggests that plays will be far more successful than any other type of theater campaign.

## Monetary Goal
For plays in the United States, most successful campaigns starting out with a goal of $10,000, are unsuccessful. Successful campaigns have a median goal of around $3,000 and a mean goal of $5,000. Our suggestion to Louis is to see how she can reduce the amount needed for her play in order for the campaign to be successful.
---
## Time of Year
We also suggest that Louis begin her campaing in May or June and run for about a month. Most successful campaigns seem to run in these months as can be seen by the graph shown.
